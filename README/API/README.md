# Jeeves API

## What is Jeeves?
The Jeeves API enables users to create test cases for their web projects by creating a mirror. Jeeves monitors web performance such as availability and throughput and creates reports of these metrics so developers can pinpoint issues to fix and features to enhance. 

## How Does It Work?
Jeeves is built on top of the Gatling Open Source Library.
For further information on how Gatling works, check the [Gatling User Guide](https://gatling.io/docs/3.3/#user-guide)

## Setup the Jeeves API
* [API Local Virtual Workspace](README/api-config.md)
* [Deployment](README/api-deployment.md)
* [Infrastructure](README/api-infrastructure.md)

Additionally, you can configure the [Jeeves WebApp](https://github.dowjones.net/SharedServices/Jeeves.WebApp) to interact graphically with Jeeves.
