# Jeeves WebApp

## What is Jeeves?
The Jeeves WebApp is a graphical extension of the [Jeeves API](https://github.dowjones.net/SharedServices/Jeeves.API) that enables users to create test cases for their web projects by creating a mirror. Jeeves monitors web performance such as availability and throughput and creates reports of these metrics so developers can pinpoint issues to fix and features to enhance. 

## How Does It Work?
Jeeves is built on top of the Gatling Open Source Library.
For further information on how Gatling works, check the [Gatling User Guide](https://gatling.io/docs/3.3/#user-guide)

## Setup the Jeeves API
* [API Local Virtual Workspace](README/webApp-config.md)
* [Deployment](README/webApp-deployment.md)


>>**Note**: You need to configure the [Jeeves API](https://github.dowjones.net/SharedServices/Jeeves.API) to be able to work with the Jeeves WebApp.
